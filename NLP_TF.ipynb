Thenappeared the man of inconceivable nature whom all the Rishis knowand so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the Vasus, and the twin Aswins ; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and most holy Brahmarshis, and thenumerous Eajarshis distinguished by every noble quality.

The latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three sons, Dasa-jyoti, Sata-jyoti, andSahasra-jyoti, each of them producing numerous offspring.

Some read the Bharatabeginning with the initial mantra (invocation), others with the story of Astika, others with Uparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole.Men of learning display their various knowledge of the institutes incommenting on the composition. Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in remembering its contents. The son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysedthe eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, when thatlearned Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, off- spring of Parasara, had finished this greatest of narrations, he beganto consider how he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor ofthe six attributes, Brahma, the world's preceptor, knowing of theanxiety of the Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place wherethe latter was, for gratifying the saint, and benefiting the people.And when Vyasa, surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, hewas surprised ; and, standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordereda seat to be brought. And Vyasa having gone round him who is calledHiranyagarbha seated on that distinguished seat stood near it ; andbeing commanded by Brahma Parameshthi, he sat down near the seat, full of affection and smiling in joy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said, \"O divine Brahma, by me a poem hathbeen composed which is greatly respected. The mystery of the Veda,and what other subjects have been explained by me ; the variousrituals of the Upanishads with the Angas ; the compilation of thePuranas and history formed by me and named after the three divisionsof time, past, present, and future ; the determination of the natureof decay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence ; a descriptionof creeds and of the various modes of life ; rule for the four castes,and the import of all the Puranas ; an account of asceticism and of theduties of a religious student ; the dimensions of the sun and moon, theplanets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of thefour ages ; the Rik, Sama and Yajur Vedas ; also the Adhyatma ; thesciences called Nyaya, Orthoepy and Treatment of diseases ; charityand Pasupatadharma ; birth celestial and human, for particular purposes ; also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places ofrivers, mountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas ; the art of war ; the different kinds of nations and languages : the natureof the manners of the people ; and the all-pervading spirit ; all thesehave been represented. But, after all, no writer of this work is to befound on earth/\n",

        "obviator of obstacles, ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was nosooner thought of, then he repaired to the place where Vyasa was seated. And when he had been saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed himthus, 'O guide of the Ganas I be thou the writer of the Bharata whichI have formed in my imagination, and which I am about to repeat/\n",
        "\"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 'I will becomethe writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a moment cease\n",
        "writing.' And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 'Wherever there by anything thou dost not comprehend, cease to continue writing.' Ganesahaving signified his assent, by repeating the word Om ! proceeded to write ; and Vyasa began ; and by way of diversion, he knit the knots of\n",

        "I am (continued Sauti) acquainted with eight thousand and eight\n",

        "Ganesa took a moment to consider ; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in great abundance.\n",
